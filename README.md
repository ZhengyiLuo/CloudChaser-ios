# CloudChaser iOS

Object Detection + Localization through Deep Learning + ARkit.

App switch from two modes:
Local - running inceptionv3 object detection locally on iphone 10
Cloud - running Yolov3 object Detection on a Paperspace cluster remotely. 

Local mode is confined to only recognize a most possible object in the frame without localization. 

Cloud mode gives the app the power to track multiple objects in real time.

This app needs a server python script to run the Cloud modes. App still in development.
